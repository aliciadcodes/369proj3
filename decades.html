        When you picture the 1960s, what colors come to mind? Perhaps psychedelic colors, warm oranges, reds and yellows? What about the 1970s? Perhaps that would be the colors of disco and lava lamps. How about the 1980s? That would be bright cyan, red, purple and yellow, right? The 1990s? How about today? It’s no surprise that colors come in and out of fashion all the time, but what were the influences behind the palette of the 1950s versus the 2000s? We took on the challenge to capture the decades with a simple color palette, sourcing inspiration from American pop culture, fashion, marketing, technology and design. Here are the colors that defined the last 100 years.
      </p>
      <p>The 2010s are known for many things: nostalgia, hipsters and minimalism. From interior design to technology, a growing interest in minimalistic, well-crafted and thoughtfully-designed items became status symbols. The most trendy interiors today feature rustic wood finishes, metallic or stone surfaces, polished copper and brass accents, and cozy deep green tropical plants all carefully arranged before airy sun-bleached white walls.

While screen resolution, camera quality and technology grew more complex, digital design simplified to what we call flat design. Flat design is constructed from geometric shapes edged with delicate drop shadows topped with simple sans-serif typography. The ensuing color palette, however, introduces a more fantastical element to the style. Joyful gradients, surrealistic saturated color is a delightful experience for users.

And then there’s millennial pink, arguably the most iconic color of the decade. For years the color has been inescapable. Wes Anderson’s The Grand Budapest Hotel featured the color, from the stately hotel’s facade to Mendel’s pastry boxes. Apple featured it as an iPhone color for the first time in 2015 (called Rose Gold), putting the color into the hands of millions. Pantone granted the color spotlight in 2016 when its variant Rose Quartz and a baby-blue Serenity were named 2016 Color of the Year. The color can easily be found anywhere in the world of design and there’s no sign we’re ready to quit it.</p>
      <p>The 2000s were marked by a time of decadence in the culture and innovation in technology. Some of the iconic shows of the time closely followed the lives of extravagant Americans, real or fictional — Paris Hilton from The Simple Life, rich teens from My Sweet 16, the outrageous cast from The Jersey Shore, Carrie Bradshaw in Sex and the City, Gretchen Wieners from Mean Girls and, of course, Kim, Khloe and Kourtney Kardashian from Keeping Up with the Kardashians. Skinny jeans finally stuck as a fashionable item, but unfortunately, so did Crocs.

It was also a notable decade for Apple. The company released the most popular portable music device in history: the iPod. Newer iterations of the device became smaller and more candy-colored. Each new generation of iPod nanos had more colors, and by the 4th Generation, there was an array of 9 colors to choose from. The iPod was finally discontinued in 2017. In 2007, the iPhone was released, making smartphones accessible to billions of people around the world. The skeuomorphic design was the trendy aesthetic, especially in web and print design. Skeuomorphic design is known for its faux real-world objects with realistic textures and colors affixed to the two-dimensional world.

Overall, the 2000s were a prosperous time with outrageous fashion, VMA appearances, pop culture happenings, and consumerism that exemplified the time. The Great Recession of 2008 certainly put a damper on economic optimism for many, and as Americans climbed out of the tough economy, they found new ways to reinvent their tastes and ideals in the trends of the next decade.</p>
      <p>Color from the 1960s to the 1980s are known for their bright, vibrant hues. Things didn’t quiet down until the 1990s, which was known for its more neutral, moody color palette. Grunge music was at its height, and alternative rock was coming into the fore; its scene was anti-materialistic and celebrated individualism over consumerism. The offices of corporate America adopted neutral colors: gray, beige and brown with mauve and burgundy accents. Tech companies who positioned their products as being fun and easy to use, such as Nintendo and Apple, released candy-colored plastic devices. Iconic shows on television such as Friends, Seinfeld and Daria also adopted a more sober and muted color palette. Alternatively, the 1990s are also known for noisy jewel-colored fashion, composed of rich blues, bright purples, deep greens, and hot reds.</p>
      <p>The 1980s was one of the first times groundbreaking technology intersected with ways to have fun. The advent of personal computing allowed computer gaming and video games to flourish. Companies created colorful, fantastical advertisements to show off the displays on their devices. Apple’s iconic logo, from 1977-1998, was rainbow-colored to make their products appear friendly to consumers and showcase the Apple II’s color display. MTV made its debut in 1981, and the era of music videos on television was born. An example of MTV’s edgy appeal was the short spots during commercial breaks where the logo was morphed and shaped by animation and quirky filmmaking. The experimental Italian design group Memphis created the energetic, electric aesthetic look of the 1980s that we recognize and lovingly replicate today.</p>
